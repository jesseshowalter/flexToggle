#flexToggle

flexToggle is a lightweight jQuery plugin that allows you to show or hide content when a toggle link is clicked. It's great for making expand/collapse boxes, disclosure triangles, drawers, and more!

##Usage

Create a link that will function as the trigger, along with a div that will be collapsed or expanded when the trigger is clicked. Point the link of the trigger to the ID of the div.

```html
<a href="#collapsible1" class="toggle">Toggle One</a>
<div class="collapsible" id="collapsible1">Content</div>

<a href="#collapsible2" class="toggle">Toggle One</a>
<div class="collapsible" id="collapsible2">Content</div>
```

In CSS, set the collapsible elements to be hidden, and set them to be displayed when they are open. If JavaScript is not available, you can use a [no-js class](http://paulirish.com/2009/avoiding-the-fouc-v3/) to open the collapsible elements:

```css
.collapsible {
	display: none;
}

.collapsible.open {
	display: block;
}

.no-js .collapsible {
	display: block;
}
```

Include jQuery and flexToggle.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="flextoggle.min.js"></script>
```

Then, call flexToggle.

```javascript
$('a.toggle').flexToggle();
```

##Options

For examples of how these can be used, see the demo page that's included with flexToggle.

###animation
string - How should we animate as it appears and disappears? Options are 'none' and 'slideDown'. Default is 'none'.

###activeText
string - Link text when drawer is open. If this or inactiveText are empty, don't change the text. By default, this is empty.

###inactiveText
string - Link text when drawer is closed. If this or activeText are empty, don't change the text. By default, this is empty. 

**Note:** The inactiveText should be included in the markup. For example, if your inactiveText is "Expand" and your activeText is "Collapse", you could write this: 
```html
<a href="#elementToOpen" class="toggle">Expand Item One</a>
```

If there are multiple instances of this text, all of them will be toggled back and forth. So this...
```html
<a href="#elementToOpen" class="toggle Expand">Expand Item One</a>
```

...would become this when the link is clicked:
```html
<a href="#elementToOpen" class="toggle Collapse">Collapse Item One</a>
```
